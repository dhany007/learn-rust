# minigrep
- make our own version of the classic command line search tool grep (globally search a regular expression and print
- grep searches a specified file for a specified string
- grep takes as its arguments a file path and a string
- Then it reads the file, finds lines in that file that contain the string argument, and prints those lines.
- Weâ€™ll also print error messages to the standard error console stream (stderr) instead of standard output (stdout)
